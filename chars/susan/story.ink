In the swirling vortex of scientific pursuit that was the Research Lab, you could find brains so big they had their own gravity. Nestled amongst these knowledge-hungry minds, Susan sat at the epicentre, her fascination for radio hardware acting like a homing signal for anyone lost in the sea of cutting-edge tech.

#background: research_lab_prop_mixer_calendar
Against one wall, a calendar loomed large, each day ticked off with the inevitability of a marching army. One particular date was circled in a red so vibrant it could have been stolen from a firework â€“ the day of the much-anticipated annual Social Mixer. This event was something of a local legend in the Research Lab, an oasis of informality in the desert of intellect, where ideas could be exchanged without the formality of a lab coat.

During the routine act of teeth brushing, Susan decides to activate your interface.

"What can I do for you, Susan?" #speaker: ai

"I've been thinking about the Social Mixer. It's like an impending storm on the horizon. Lily's friendly enough, but Derek's like a cloud with a grudge. What do you think?" #speaker: susan

    * [Encourage Susan to brave the Social Mixer.]
        Your digital nudge seems to put some steel in Susan's resolve. After all, a little rain never hurt anyone. And who knows, she might even find a rainbow.

    * [Suggest that Susan should avoid the storm and focus on her work.]
        Susan mulls over your advice. The idea of weathering the storm in the safety of her work seems to appeal to her. After all, even the biggest storms can't touch you if you're indoors.
